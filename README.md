# Kaboom_Mario
A quick practice app using Kaboom.js to make a 2d game 
The tutorial was done by Ania Kub√≥w and can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nucjefSr6I
I will be using this as a base for a react native app to play old nes games recreated in javascript, ghosts and goblins should be a hoot to make.
